Flashing BIOS is risky, improper operation may cause serious problems such as failure to boot.
Changing CPU is risky, improper operation may cause permanent hardware damage that cannot be repaired.
BIOS is not 100% compatible with all computers, there is a possibility that you will not be able to boot your computer after flashing, so it is not recommended to try it without a programmer.
Please read the tutorials carefully and at your own risk, I and the posters and forums do not take any responsibility for the failure of the BIOS flashing and dismantling.
There is a risk of losing system activation and serial number when flashing a modified BIOS, so please think twice before doing so.
There is a very small chance that after flashing the BIOS in normal operation, the system will not boot up, but if you use a programmer to re-flash the same file, the system will be fine, which is a normal phenomenon.
I don't own the copyright of the BIOS and the software in it, please use it legally for research and study purposes.
If you have fixed some undiscovered bugs based on this BIOS and suggested improvements, please continue to publicize and share the results of your work.
